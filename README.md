# 🔍 Log Analyzer System  

A **Python-based automated log analysis tool** that processes raw log files, detects anomalies, checks for known threats, and generates alerts with a structured dashboard view.  

This project provides a **modular solution for system monitoring and security analysis**, transforming unstructured log data into actionable insights.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- 📑 **Log Parsing** – Extracts IPs, timestamps, and request details from raw logs  
- 🛡️ **Threat Intelligence** – Flags requests from known malicious IPs  
- 📊 **Anomaly Detection** – Identifies unusual activity patterns (e.g., sudden request surges)  
- 🚨 **Alerting System** – Generates alerts based on JSON rules  
- 📈 **Dashboard** – Provides a summary view of analysis results  
- ⚡ **Modular Design** – Easy to extend with new components  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Regex** for parsing  
- **JSON** for config & alert rules

## ⚙️ Installation  

### 1. Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/log-analyzer.git
cd log-analyzer

### 2. (Optional) Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

### 3. Install dependencies (if required later)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# ▶️ Usage

Place your log file in the project directory (default: access.txt).

###Run the analyzer:

python3 main.py --file access.txt


View results in console & dashboard output.

# 📊 Workflow

log_parser.py → Parses raw logs

threat_intel.py → Flags malicious IPs

anomaly_detector.py → Detects abnormal patterns

alerter.py → Triggers alerts from alerts.json rules

dashboard.py → Displays summary report

main.py → Orchestrates the full pipeline

# 🚀 Future Enhancements

Real-time log streaming

Web-based dashboard

Machine Learning for anomaly detection

SIEM integration

# 📌 Conclusion

The Log Analyzer System provides a practical, modular approach to automated log analysis and threat detection.
It serves as a foundation for building more advanced monitoring and cybersecurity tools.
