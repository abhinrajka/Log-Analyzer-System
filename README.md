Log Analyzer SystemOverviewThe Log Analyzer System is a powerful, Python-based tool designed to process, analyze, and monitor log data. It helps system administrators and developers transform raw, unstructured log files into actionable insights. By leveraging a modular architecture, the system can parse log entries, detect anomalies, identify security threats, and provide a clear, summarized view of system activity. This project is ideal for anyone who needs to automate log management to improve operational efficiency and security.FeaturesLog Parsing: Efficiently reads log files and extracts key data fields (e.g., timestamps, IP addresses, HTTP status codes) into a structured format.Anomaly Detection: Automatically identifies unusual patterns in log data that may indicate a system issue, such as a sudden spike in errors or traffic.Threat Intelligence: Cross-references IP addresses from log entries against a list of known malicious entities to flag potential security threats.Alerting System: Notifies administrators when predefined conditions are met, ensuring a timely response to critical events.Dashboard: Provides a simple, script-based summary of log data and analysis results, giving a high-level overview of system health.InstallationTo get started, clone this repository to your local machine.git clone [https://github.com/abhinrajka/Log-Analyzer-System.git](https://github.com/abhinrajka/Log-Analyzer-System.git)
cd Log-Analyzer-System
The system requires Python 3. You may need to install additional libraries depending on your specific needs, but the core functionality uses standard Python libraries.UsageThe system is executed from the command line. To run the analysis on your log files, simply run the main script.python3 main.py
The system will automatically read and process the access.log file, running the parsing, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence modules. The output will be displayed in the terminal and alerts will be logged according to the rules in alerts.json.File Structuremain.py: The main script that orchestrates the entire log analysis workflow.log_parser.py: Contains the logic for parsing raw log files into a structured format.anomaly_detector.py: Implements the algorithms for identifying unusual patterns and behavior in the log data.threat_intel.py: Responsible for checking log data against security threat lists.alerter.py: Manages the alerting system, triggering notifications based on predefined rules.alerts.json: A configuration file that defines the rules and conditions for generating alerts.config.py: Contains global configuration settings, such as thresholds for anomaly detection and file paths.dashboard.py: Handles the visualization and summary of the analysis results.access.log: A sample log file for testing and demonstration.LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.
