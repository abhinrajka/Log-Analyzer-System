🔍 Log Analyzer SystemA Python-based automated log analysis tool that processes raw log files, detects anomalies, checks for known threats, and generates alerts with a structured dashboard view. This project provides a modular solution for system monitoring and security analysis, transforming unstructured log data into actionable insights.✨ FeaturesLog Parsing – Extracts IPs, timestamps, and request details from raw logsThreat Intelligence – Flags requests from known malicious IPsAnomaly Detection – Identifies unusual activity patterns (e.g., sudden request surges)Alerting System – Generates alerts based on JSON rulesDashboard – Provides a summary view of analysis resultsModular Design – Easy to extend with new components🛠️ Tech StackPython 3.xRegex for parsingJSON for config & alert rules📂 Project Structurelog-analyzer/

⚙️ Installation1. Clone the repositorygit clone [https://github.com/your-username/log-analyzer.git](https://github.com/your-username/log-analyzer.git)
cd log-analyzer
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment# Linux/Mac
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies (if required later)pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ UsagePlace your log file in the project directory (default: access.txt).Run the analyzer:python3 main.py --file access.txt
